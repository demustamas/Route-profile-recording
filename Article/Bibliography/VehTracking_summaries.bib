  abstract = {Global positioning system (GPS) tracker is an innovative technology that is able to track the position of vehicle using global satellite system. In this paper, vehicle tracker system design that is derived from global positioning system and global system for mobile communication (GSM) interface with the use of Arduino Uno board as platform is proposed and presented. Technology in Arduino, GSM, and GPS is studied.GPS module receives the coordinates from the satellite. The GPS coordinates are sent to users in the form of SMS through SIM900A GSM module. By using Google Maps, the exact location of the vehicle can be located. Arduino microcontroller is the gateway to all GPS and GSM hardware and software communication in the system. The design represents that GSM and GPS interface with the use of Arduino Uno board as platform can really make vehicle tracking more efficient and convenient since it can work in any weather conditions and provide real-time location of objects. Automatic display of the coordinate's geographical location in a map should be integrated in future design. © 2021 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Mobile Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements carried out on the railway consist of using satellite navigation systems to determine the track geometry of a moving railway vehicle on a given route. Their purposes include diagnostics, stocktaking, and design work in railways. The greatest advantage of this method is the ability to perform measurements in a unified and coherent spatial reference system, which effectively enables the combining of design and construction works, as well as their implementation by engineering teams of diverse specialties. In the article, we attempted to assess the impact of using three types of work mode for a GNSS geodetic network [Global Positioning System (GPS), GPS/Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) and GPS/GLONASS/Galileo] on positioning availability at three accuracy levels: 1 cm, 3 cm and 10 cm. This paper presents a mathematical model that enables the calculation of positioning availability at these levels. This model was also applied to the results of the measurement campaign performed by five GNSS geodetic receivers, made by a leading company in the field. Measurements with simultaneous position recording and accuracy assessment were taken separately on the same route for three types of receiver settings: GPS, GPS/GLONASS and GPS/GLONASS/Galileo in an urban area typical of a medium-sized city. The study has shown that applying a two-system solution (GPS/GLONASS) considerably increases the availability of high-precision coordinates compared to a single-system solution (GPS), whereas the measurements with three systems (GPS/GLONASS/Galileo) negligibly increase the availability compared to a two-system solution (GPS/GLONASS).},

  abstract = {The problem of the reproduction of the railway geometric layout in the global spatial system is currently solved in the form of measurements that use geodetic railway networks and also, in recent years, efficient methods of mobile positioning (mainly satellite and inert). The team of authors from the Gdańsk University of Technology and the Maritime University in Gdynia as part of the research project InnoSatTrack is looking for effective and efficient methods for the inventory of railway lines. The research is part of a wider investigation BRIK (Research and Development in Railway Infrastructure, in polish: Badania i Rozwój w Infrastrukturze Kolejowej). This paper presents a comparative analysis of the problem of the reproduction of the trajectory of the measuring system using tacheometry, satellite measurements made using a measurement trolley, and mobile satellite measurements. Algorithms enabling the assessment of the compliance of satellite measurements with classic tacheometric measurements were presented. To this end, the authors held measurement sessions using modern geodetic instruments and satellite navigation on a section of the railway line. The results of the measurements indicate the convergence of the level of accuracy achieved by different measuring techniques. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract = {The article discusses an important issue in connection with the technique of mobile Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements of railway track coordinates, which is digital filtering performed to precisely determine railway track axes. For this purpose, a measuring technique is proposed which bases on the use of a measuring platform with a number of appropriately distributed GNSS receivers, where two of them determine the directional base vector of the platform. The receivers used in the research had high measuring frequency in the Real Time Kinematic (RTK) operating mode and enabled correction of the obtained results in post–processing. A key problem discussed in the article is the method for assessing the quality of the measurement results obtained from GNSS receivers, and their preparation for further processing making use of geometrically constrained parameters of the base vector and specialized digital filtering, among other elements, to precisely determining the track axis. The obtained results confirm the applicability of the used method of GNSS signal processing. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},
