In this paper, vehicle tracker system design that is derived from global positioning system and global system for mobile communication (GSM) interface with the use of Arduino Uno board as platform is proposed and presented. Technology in Arduino, GSM, and GPS is studied.GPS module receives the coordinates from the satellite. The GPS coordinates are sent to users in the form of SMS through SIM900A GSM module. By using Google Maps, the exact location of the vehicle can be located. Arduino microcontroller is the gateway to all GPS and GSM hardware and software communication in the system. The design represents that GSM and GPS interface with the use of Arduino Uno board as platform can really make vehicle tracking more efficient and convenient since it can work in any weather conditions and provide real-time location of objects. Automatic display of the coordinate's geographical location in a map should be integrated in future design. © 2021 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Mobile Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements carried out on the railway consist of using satellite navigation systems to determine the track geometry of a moving railway vehicle on a given route. Their purposes include diagnostics, stocktaking, and design work in railways. The greatest advantage of this method is the ability to perform measurements in a unified and coherent spatial reference system, which effectively enables the combining of design and construction works, as well as their implementation by engineering teams of diverse specialties. In the article, we attempted to assess the impact of using three types of work mode for a GNSS geodetic network [Global Positioning System (GPS), GPS/Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) and GPS/GLONASS/Galileo] on positioning availability at three accuracy levels: 1 cm, 3 cm and 10 cm. This paper presents a mathematical model that enables the calculation of positioning availability at these levels. This model was also applied to the results of the measurement campaign performed by five GNSS geodetic receivers, made by a leading company in the field. Measurements with simultaneous position recording and accuracy assessment were taken separately on the same route for three types of receiver settings: GPS, GPS/GLONASS and GPS/GLONASS/Galileo in an urban area typical of a medium-sized city. The study has shown that applying a two-system solution (GPS/GLONASS) considerably increases the availability of high-precision coordinates compared to a single-system solution (GPS), whereas the measurements with three systems (GPS/GLONASS/Galileo) negligibly increase the availability compared to a two-system solution (GPS/GLONASS).},

The team of authors from the Gdańsk University of Technology and the Maritime University in Gdynia as part of the research project InnoSatTrack is looking for effective and efficient methods for the inventory of railway lines. The research is part of a wider investigation BRIK (Research and Development in Railway Infrastructure, in polish: Badania i Rozwój w Infrastrukturze Kolejowej). This paper presents a comparative analysis of the problem of the reproduction of the trajectory of the measuring system using tacheometry, satellite measurements made using a measurement trolley, and mobile satellite measurements. Algorithms enabling the assessment of the compliance of satellite measurements with classic tacheometric measurements were presented. To this end, the authors held measurement sessions using modern geodetic instruments and satellite navigation on a section of the railway line. The results of the measurements indicate the convergence of the level of accuracy achieved by different measuring techniques. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the development of advanced systems and applications has propelled the adoption of autonomous railway traffic and train positioning, with several ongoing initiatives and experimental testbeds aimed at proving the suitability and reliability of the Global Navigation Satellite System signals and services, in this specific application domain. To satisfy the strict safety and accuracy requirements aimed at assuring the position solution’s integrity, availability, accuracy and reliability, recent proposals suggest the hybridization of the Global Navigation Satellite System with other technologies. The integration with localization techniques that are expected to be available with the upcoming fifth generation mobile communication networks is among the most promising approaches. In this work, different approaches to the design of hybrid positioning solutions for the railway sector are examined, under the perspective of the uncertainty evaluation of the attained results and performance. In fact, the way the uncertainty associated to the positioning measurements performed by different studies is reported is often not consistent with the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement, and this makes it very difficult to fairly compare the different approaches in order to identify the best emerging solution. Under this perspective, the review provided by this work highlights a number of open issues that should drive future research activities in this field.},

For this purpose, a measuring technique is proposed which bases on the use of a measuring platform with a number of appropriately distributed GNSS receivers, where two of them determine the directional base vector of the platform. The receivers used in the research had high measuring frequency in the Real Time Kinematic (RTK) operating mode and enabled correction of the obtained results in post–processing. A key problem discussed in the article is the method for assessing the quality of the measurement results obtained from GNSS receivers, and their preparation for further processing making use of geometrically constrained parameters of the base vector and specialized digital filtering, among other elements, to precisely determining the track axis. The obtained results confirm the applicability of the used method of GNSS signal processing. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},
